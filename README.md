## Project Description
Exploring Covid data, currently focusing on mobility data.  Examining patterns, data munging using Covid_analytics.ipynb. Evaluating transportation rates by type ().
## Questions
### 1. Given shelter in place orders, is there a difference in population behavior based on state?
### 2. Does type of transport / purpose have an impact on behavioral changes?

## Solution / Method
Data from google_mobility/us-mobility.csv and New_York_Times/covid-19-state-level-data.csv. Data from the two csv files were combined into one json file. This data will populate a React table. Table will be filterable by state. This will be supplemented by plot comparing cases to transportation trends.
## Installing
